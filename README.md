# Algorithms-and-Data-structure
Here is all my work related to problem solving, implementations of different algorithms and data structures from scratch in C++.

## Algorithms_Toolbox
I've finished Algorithmic Toolbox Course of 'Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization' offered by university of california san diego.

## Data-structure
Here is the implementation of different data-strucutres (Array-based and linked-based implementation) from scratch in C++: 
* Stack
* Queue
* List
* Binary search tree
